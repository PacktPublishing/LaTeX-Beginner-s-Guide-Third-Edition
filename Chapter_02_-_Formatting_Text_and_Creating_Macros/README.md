## Formatting Text and Creating Macros

In the last chapter, we installed LaTeX and wrote our first document using both the TeXworks editor and Overleaf.
Now, we’ll take a closer look at the structure of text, focusing on formatting and fine-tuning details.

In this chapter, we’ll cover the following:

- Using logical formatting  
- Understanding how LaTeX processes your input  
- Modifying text fonts  
- Using color  
- Limiting paragraph width  
- Breaking lines and paragraphs  
- Changing text alignment  
- Displaying quotations  
- Creating commands  
- Creating environments  
- Using an alternative syntax  

Through hands-on examples and trying the features, you’ll learn some essential LaTeX concepts.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll be comfortable working with commands and environments and be able to define custom commands.
