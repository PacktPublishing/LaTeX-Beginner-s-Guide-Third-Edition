## Designing Pages

Now that you know how to format text, it’s time to look at entire pages and the overall document structure.

In this chapter, we’ll structure a document using chapters and sections, and learn how to adjust its
page layout, including margins, page orientation, headers, and footers. This gives you control over the entire document design.

We’ll cover the following topics:

- Structuring with chapters  
- Adjusting page margins  
- Creating a two-column layout  
- Designing headers and footers  
- Adding footnotes  
- Handling page breaks  
- Enlarging a page  
- Changing line spacing  
- Aligning the text area height  
- Creating a table of contents  

Working through these will build a better understanding of document classes and packages.

We’ll start with a multi-page example document that we’ll keep using throughout the chapters
to try out new features. You can view, edit, and compile it online on the [book’s website](https://latexguide.org/chapter-03).
