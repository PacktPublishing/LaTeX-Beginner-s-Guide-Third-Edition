## Getting Started with LaTeX

You are familiar with word processing software: you type some text, and what you see on the screen
is what you get on the page. In contrast, LaTeX is a typesetting system: you write plain text with
arkup commands, and LaTeX turns it into polished output. It produces high-quality prints and PDF files
based on sophisticated algorithms for justification, hyphenation, text alignment, whitespace balancing,
and figure placement. It comes with predefined formatting styles for headings, margins,
and general page layout, which you can customize.

Now that you’re ready to move beyond those “what you see is what you get” word processors
and start using a system designed for precision and consistency, you’re in the right place.
Let’s take the first steps together.

This book will guide you along the way, helping you get the most out of LaTeX’s capabilities.
First, we’ll look at its strengths and a few challenges before setting up the tools you’ll need.

In this chapter, we’ll get acquainted with LaTeX, what it is, and how to install and use it.
Specifically, we’ll cover the following:

- Getting the LaTeX idea  
- Installing and using LaTeX  
- Working with LaTeX online  
- Accessing documentation  

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have LaTeX up and running, know how to edit and typeset a basic document, and understand where to find further documentation.
